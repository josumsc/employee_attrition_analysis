# Employee Attrition - Causes and Explanations

Retaining talent is as important as capturing it, and some may say it is even more, due to the time and money invested in adapting a certain worker to your environment and company. Thus, I think that taking a glance to the main characteristics of the workers that decide to leave their company is worth of our time.

To examine this fact, I will use the dataset Employee Attrition located at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/patelprashant/employee-attrition?select=WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv) as it contains data gathered specifically for this use case. The version used in this study specifically is also stored in the folder **data/** as the file located in the website may change with the time and not correspond with the one examined here.

## File Structure

* **data/**: Version of the dataset used in the analysis.
* **doc/**: Documents, both in HTML (prefered version) and PDF (without embedded plots) with the findings and main conclusions of the study.
* **src/**: Code used in the project, in .Rmd format.
